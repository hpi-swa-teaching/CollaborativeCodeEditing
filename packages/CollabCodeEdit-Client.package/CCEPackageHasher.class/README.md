I build hashes from packages.

These hashes can be used to compare the initial state of packages between different collaborators.



Instance Variables
	classHash:		aNumber
	classesWithHashes:		anOrderedDictionary
	methodsWithHashes:		anOrderedDictionary
	packageHash:		aNumber

classHash
	- xxxxx

classesWithHashes
	- xxxxx

methodsWithHashes
	- xxxxx

packageHash
	- xxxxx
